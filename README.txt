# LOVEDOC

The LOVEDOC is an expert system for those facing difficult situations in
their love life. This expert system claims to have the ability to
determine if someone is a match for the user, and helps to provide
the user with advice.

The user enters data based on the situation they are in, and the program
determines the correct path to take and the possibility of success in the
courtship of the said man or woman.

## System

LOVEDOC is written in Lisp, for the Java Expert System Shell (jess).
The program must be run from an installation of the jess shell.

LOVEDOC is implemented upon the Rete Algorithm for production-rule
systems, and uses backward chaining for most of its primary computations.
